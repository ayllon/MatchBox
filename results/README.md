Results
=======
The datasets used are referenced under the folder `/data`.

These results were obtained running repeatedly the script `/bin/benchmark.py` on a cluster managed by
[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html). The jobs were limited to 24 hours. Parallel submissions
were used to increase the number of data-points.

The nodes were running Cent-OS release 7.7, with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5218 CPU @ 2.30GHz.
Jobs were single-core.
